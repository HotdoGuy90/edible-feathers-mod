# Edible Feathers Mod
This is a mod in Bedrock used to make feathers able to be eaten! Go to the page called Releases and download the .mcaddon file. Double-Click it and it should open Minecraft. Make sure the version of Minecraft is 1.20.0 or higher, otherwise it won't work. Then activate it.
## Experiments
Make sure to activate Holiday Creator Features and Upcoming Creator Features while setting it up.
## Obtaining The Item
You can get it in the creative menu in the nature section, using `/give @s ccjhdg:edible_feather` or crafting it below:
